# Uber-Booking-Cancellation-Project
I built a project that analyzes Uber booking and cancellation patterns using MySQL for data storage, cleaning, and querying, and Power BI for interactive visualization. It provides insights into customer behavior, peak booking times, cancellation trends, and vehicle-type preferences to support data-driven decision-making.
